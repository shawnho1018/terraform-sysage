### Infrastructure as code : NSX-T + vSphere
This work is my first trial for Infrastructure as code using Terraform. The idea is to create a replicable infrastructure before the deployment of applications/servers. <br>
This topology uses NSX-T 2.5 + vSphere 6.7U3 as the basis. The covered infrastructure includes the creations of
* Virtual Machine
* T1 Router
* Logical Switch
* Load Balancer 
* Virtual Service
<br>
The detailed explanation could refer to [the following blog](https://medium.com/%E8%BC%95%E9%AC%86%E5%B0%8F%E5%93%81-pks%E8%88%87k8s%E7%9A%84%E9%BB%9E%E6%BB%B4/infrastructure-as-code-%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8-i-%E7%B0%A1%E6%98%93%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E6%8B%93%E5%A2%A3%E6%9E%B6%E8%A8%AD-336a3ced16b6)
